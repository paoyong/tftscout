Once a player dies, the amount of rounds before you can face the same player goes down by 1

Thus...

8 = 5 rounds

7 = 4 rounds

6 = 3 rounds

5 = 2 rounds

The only time matchmaking completely resets is when thereâ€™s 3 players left

ghosts are completely separate. how it determines which ghost you are fighting and who is fighting the ghost is a pretty big ?, it could even be completely random, you can definitely face a player twice in a row if you are including the ghost.
